#### Steps to be follwed to run the project
1. Ensure you have node installed, if not please install it using brew or apt-get command or any other procedure which you are comfortable with.
2. You need to install few other node libraries to run an webproject, Instead of installing each and every library seperately please run the command npm install, this command will install all the node modules that you specified in package.json
